# Making-graph-from-the-OMNI-web-data
Data taken from  https://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/omni_min.html and making graph for analysis using matplotlib and pandas

The program can be customized easily for the different data we are taking.

Plan for next commit:
- BUG:: The part for making column of time_date is not efficient and is bugged. The bug doesn't seems to be big issuse in scatter plot 
        but for line plot it is an issuse. 
- FEATURE::  Want to make the program more customizable.
